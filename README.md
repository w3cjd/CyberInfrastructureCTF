# Cyber Infrastructure & Technologies "Capture The Flag" Challenge

Scope: Given the provided scenario, access and review security events within a SIEM system to investigate a potential incident and capture a hidden “flag.” 

COMPLETED TASKS: 
- The credentials to a Splunk SIEM server, not provided with the project, were found on a POP3 mail server also existing within the environment.
- A search within Splunk for records of suspicious download attempts, as per the given scenario, was made. The download sources from within the logs were further investigated to find and then decode the hidden “flag.”

Project environment and steps taken are fully documented in the report.

This course was part of my studies in the Cybersecurity Professional Bootcamp at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
